*Libraries:

In order to create new functions to the app and for a better organization, this project works with this libraries:

React-styled-component: To have greater order in the jsx and have the possibility of reusing predominant and redundant components in the code making them customizable. https://styled-components.com/docs

React-drop-zone: A library that allows users to drag and drop images/files/videos to an input area instead of following the same procedure by a standard input. https://react-dropzone.js.org/#section-examples

React-router-dom: A decision taken to allow the project not to get tired with database calls and state changes at too high levels that could influence and burden navigation. https://reactrouter.com/en/main
